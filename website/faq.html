            <dd>
                In the early 1990s, Louis-Dreyfus became famous for the role of Elaine Benes on NBC's Seinfeld. She
                played the role for nine seasons, appearing in all but three episodes. One of the episodes that she did
                not appear in was the pilot episode, "The Seinfeld Chronicles", because her character was not initially
                intended to be a part of the series. It was only after the first episode that NBC executives felt the
                show was too male-centric and demanded that creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld add a woman to the
                cast. It was revealed in the commentary on the DVD package that the addition of a female character was
                the condition for commissioning the show.

                shows throughout the 1990s. Her performance earned her two Golden Globe Award nominations, winning once
                in 1994, nine Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning one in 1995 and two in both 1997 and 1998,
                and seven American Comedy Awards, winning five times in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998. In 1996, she

                nominated for on seven occasions from 1992 to 1998. After receiving the award, Louis-Dreyfus claimed the
                win was a <q>shocker</q>, and that after being in both positions, it was <q>much better to win than to
                    lose.</q>
