        Julia Scarlett Elizabeth Louis-Dreyfus was born in New York City on January 13, 1961. Her American-born
        mother, Judith (née LeFever), was a writer and special needs tutor, and her French-born father, Gérard
        Louis-Dreyfus, chaired the Louis Dreyfus Company. Her paternal grandfather, Pierre Louis-Dreyfus, was
        president of the Louis Dreyfus Group; he was a member of a Jewish family from Alsace and served as a cavalry
        officer and member of the French Resistance during World War II.

        She is also a great-great-granddaughter of
        Léopold Louis-Dreyfus, who in 1851 founded the Louis Dreyfus Group, a French commodities and shipping
        conglomerate, which members of her family still control; and is distantly related to Alfred Dreyfus of the
        infamous Dreyfus affair. Her paternal grandmother was born in the US, of partial Mexican origin, and
        Catholic; during the 1940s, she moved Julia's father to America from France.

        In 1962, one year after Louis-Dreyfus's birth, her parents divorced. After moving to Washington, D.C., when
        Julia was four, her mother married L. Thompson Bowles, dean of the George Washington University Medical
        School; Louis-Dreyfus gained a half-sister Lauren Bowles, also an actress.

        Due to her stepfather's work with
        Project HOPE, Louis-Dreyfus spent her childhood in several states and countries, including Colombia, Sri
        Lanka, and Tunisia. She graduated from the all-girls Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1979. She
        later said, <q>There were things I did in school that, had there been boys in the classroom, I would have been less motivated to do. For instance, I was president of the honor society.</q>

        Louis-Dreyfus garnered critical acclaim for her performance on the series, and she was a regular winner and
        nominee at television award shows throughout the 1990s. Her performance earned her two Golden Globe Award
        nominations, winning once in 1994, nine Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning one in 1995 and two
        in both 1997 and 1998, and seven American Comedy Awards, winning five times. During her time on Seinfeld,
        she appeared in several films, including <cite>Fathers' Day</cite>, opposite Robin Williams and Billy
        Crystal, and Woody Allen's Oscar-nominated <cite>Deconstructing Harry</cite>.
