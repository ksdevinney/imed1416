                Julia Scarlett Elizabeth Louis-Dreyfus was born in New York City on January 13, 1961. Her American-born
                mother, Judith (née LeFever), was a writer and special needs tutor, and her French-born father, Gérard
                Louis-Dreyfus, chaired the Louis Dreyfus Company. Her paternal grandfather, Pierre Louis-Dreyfus, was
                president of the Louis Dreyfus Group; he was a member of a Jewish family from Alsace and served as a
                cavalry
                officer and member of the French Resistance during World War II.

                She is also a great-great-granddaughter of
                Léopold Louis-Dreyfus, who in 1851 founded the Louis Dreyfus Group, a French commodities and shipping
                conglomerate, which members of her family still control; and is distantly related to Alfred Dreyfus of
                the
                infamous Dreyfus affair. Her paternal grandmother was born in the US, of partial Mexican origin, and
                Catholic; during the 1940s, she moved Julia's father to America from France.

                In 1962, one year after Louis-Dreyfus's birth, her parents divorced. After moving to Washington, D.C.,
                when
                Julia was four, her mother married L. Thompson Bowles, dean of the George Washington University Medical
                School; Louis-Dreyfus gained a half-sister Lauren Bowles, also an actress.

                Lanka, and Tunisia. She graduated from the all-girls Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1979.
