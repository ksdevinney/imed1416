# IMED1407: Intro to Web Design

These are the notes and final product from IMED 1407, Introduction to Web Design. I took this class at Dallas College in Spring 2022.

This repo consists of two parts: my notes and my website. Each chapter I studied was relevant to a specific assignment. Chapters 1-9 are related to HTML, 11-17 are about CSS, and chapters 21-22 are a brief overview of JavaScript.

For the subject of my website, I chose actress Julia Louis-Dreyfuss. This website is not meant to me informative; it is mostly for applying new techniques and best practices. The website was written and updated throughout the semester, with tasks relevant to each concept we studied in class. *Over the next few weeks, I will be editing this to reflect what I think is more cohesive... ;)*

While I had some familiarity with HTML and CSS at the beginning of this class, studying the foundations as laid out in the textbook helped me understand how certain concepts work.
